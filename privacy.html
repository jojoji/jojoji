        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

        <p>Most of the information we collect is limited to "Device Information" and "Gameplay Data" which does not

        <h3>A. Information Collected Automatically</h3>

        <p>When you use our Games, we may automatically collect the following information through our third-party

            </li>

            <li><strong>Network Information:</strong> IP address (which may be used to estimate your general location,
                e.g., country or city).</li>

            <li><strong>Gameplay Data:</strong> Game progress, scores, achievements, and interactions within the game.
            </li>

        </ul>



        <h3>B. Information You Provide</h3>

        <p>We do not require you to create an account to play our Games. However, we may collect information if you
            contact us directly for support (e.g., your email address and the content of your message).</p>



        <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>

        <p>We use the collected information for the following purposes:</p>

        <ul>

            <li>To analyze game usage and optimize player experience (e.g., fixing crashes or difficulty balancing).
            </li>

            <li>To serve personalized advertisements (via third-party ad networks).</li>

            <li>To prevent fraud and ensure security.</li>

            <li>To comply with legal obligations.</li>

        </ul>



        <h2>3. Third-Party Services and Advertising</h2>

        <p>Since our Games are free to play, we work with third-party advertising partners to serve ads. These partners
            may collect and use your data (such as Advertising IDs and IP addresses) to provide personalized ads.</p>

        </ul>

        <p>We encourage you to review the privacy policies of these third-party service providers directly.</p>



        <h2>4. Your Rights and Choices</h2>

                iOS).</li>

            <li><strong>Access and Deletion:</strong> You may request access to or deletion of the personal data we hold
                about you by contacting us. Note that since we do not store user accounts, we may identify you only by
                your Device ID.</li>

                information.</li>

        </ul>



        <h2>5. Data Retention</h2>

        <p>We retain your information only for as long as is necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy.

        </p>



        <h2>8. International Data Transfers</h2>

        <p>Your information may be transferred to, and processed in, countries other than the country in which you are
            resident (such as servers in the United States or Singapore). These countries may have data protection laws
            that are different from the laws of your country.</p>



        <h2>9. Changes to This Policy</h2>
